--Analysis: In this project, I collected information from a superstore database, focusing on item listings, prices, stock levels, and customer ratings across various categories.
--Dataset: https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/PvBAaQwEUSWAxZCsg4Vmx/0 
--Skills demonstrated: data manipulation, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

-- 1. Use a SELECT statment to order the items by price.
SELECT item_name, price
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price;

-- 2. Show a statistic about the stock quantity.
SELECT SUM(stock_quantity)
FROM superstore;

-- 3. Show a statistic about the price for items in the category of "Kitchen Supplies".
SELECT AVG(price), "Kitchen_Supplies"
FROM superstore;

-- 4. Show the stock quantity of "Air Purifiers" and change column name.
SELECT SUM(stock_quantity) AS total_air_purifiers_in_stock
FROM superstore
WHERE item_name = "Air Purifier";
