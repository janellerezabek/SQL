--Analysis: In this project, I extracted various insights from a Netflix titles database using PostgreSQL, focusing on content counts, recent additions, sorting, directorship, and historical records.
--Dataset:Â https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/pfsdrKi9cgCDp4Wwb77AF/0

/* 1. How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows) */
SELECT count(*)
FROM "netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie';

/* 2. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database? */
SELECT max(date(date_added))
FROM "netflix_titles_info";

/* 3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order. */
SELECT type, title 
FROM "netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title ASC;

/* 4. Who was the Director for the movie The Starling? */
SELECT director
FROM "netflix_titles_info" titles
LEFT OUTER JOIN "netflix_people" people
ON people.show_id = titles.show_id
WHERE titles.title = 'The Starling';

/* 5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made? */
SELECT title, release_year 
FROM "netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie'
AND release_year <= 
(SELECT MIN(release_year) 
FROM "netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie');
