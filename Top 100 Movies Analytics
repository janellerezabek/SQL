--Analysis: In this project, I utilized data found from the Top 100 Movies dataset, and analyzed the data by writing SQL to answer specific questions about the list.
--Dataset: https://gist.github.com/pamelafox/c705b02114ea3db0dff0
--Skills demonstrated: data manipulation, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

--What was the average amount earned globally by each studio between 2002-2012?
SELECT studio, ROUND(AVG(worldwide)) AS global_average FROM topmovies
  GROUP BY studio
  HAVING year BETWEEN "2002" AND "2012";

--Which movies from the Top 100 list were released before 2000?
SELECT title, year FROM topmovies
  WHERE year < 2000;

--I want to show how the amount grossed overseas has changed over the years with increased technology / population / marketing / media access.
SELECT year, ROUND(AVG(overseas)) AS overseas_grossing FROM topmovies
  GROUP BY year;

--I want to display the database ordered by year. 
SELECT * FROM topmovies
  ORDER BY year;
