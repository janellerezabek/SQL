—Analysis: In this project, I created a set of questions that a job seeker might be interested in learning about from the data. I used a Fortune 500 dataset and wrote SQL to answer the questions – what might be good to know about a company before working there? What would be an interesting way to compare certain companies or industries to others?
--Dataset: https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/saxdDCCyos6z6UdpjeEXSJ/0  
--Skills demonstrated: CASE statement, HAVING clause, logical operators, aggregate functions, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), data manipulation
